    description:  "I must say that I truly enjoyed taking the ASP Home Staging Course. It was like a breath of fresh air because I am one of the only Realtors that offers \"complimentary\" Staging for my clients. I truly believe in the benefits of staging and it's nice to now have the statistics and the \"scripts\" to back up my beliefs. I have been staging homes, apartment models, and club houses, offices for years and I know the class will enhance my staging technique and encourage a profitable business venture in the future. In my opinion, the class is very beneficial for Realtors"

    description:  "Just wanted to drop you a quick note to let you know how very much I enjoyed the 2 day class this past week.  Obtaining my ASP-RE Â® has been a goal of mine for the last two years and I am just THRILLED to have finally accomplished that goal.  SO much of what you talked about, the scripts you encouraged us to use, and the staging process and techniques are part of my \"way of doing things\" already.  However, we learn everyday, IF we are open to it, and I certainly DID learn a great deal as well."

    description:  "The class was a great refresher for me, and as I was back in my office the remainder of the week, looking at MLS properties, so many things - wrong - stood out that I hadn't really paid much attention to in recent years.  You made the class very enjoyable and your knowledge is priceless :-)<br /><br /> Had a listing appt on Thursday and I'm back to incorporating staging with the customers.I already put into practice this week, on that appt, things learned from the class (probate/estate listing- green carpet in one room, but the eldest sibling's words - \"I'm not putting anymore money into this house\" ) but she's excited as well in the transformation with what little pieces and artwork were left in the house to stage with. I am excited about learning who the local Stagers are so I can begin incorporating them into my listing/marketing presentations. Be assured though, I will recommend having Stagers come in, as I Do Not want to tackle the staging projects myself :-)"

    description:  "The ASP training course is fantastic!  It is filled with valuable information to not only help get me started but also touches on how to succeed in my career as an ASP Stager later down the line.  After taking the class, I believe that it is imperative to receive proper training before getting my feet wet as a Stager.  The 3-day class and the industry knowledge that you shared with us during the class will help me avoid some of the pitfalls that many Stagers face and kick start me in the right direction.  Any one that can take the amount of information presented in the 3-day class, keep eager-to-learn adults on the same page, keep it entertaining and engaging is a fantastic teacher.  You were a wealth of knowledge and very straight forward in your training style."

    description:  "I feel so fortunate to have taken the ASP course again, with you!  You made it so clear that at the center of all of your success was your discovery that Staging Sayings, and Let Me Tell You How I Work, really do work! Also, that they are at the heart of your success, and that we should internalize it to realize our own success. What made your course Inspiring was to hear your story of how you grew your business, as well as your demonstration of how to create one's marketing and income plan. Though hard work, it revealed a path to success. I think the most important lesson I took away was to to exude confidence in my \"staging genius\". For me that means allowing the confidence I do have to be perceived by others. Having completed your course, I am ready and so excited to make my business a success!!"
